# UdacityShoppingApp

This is a project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree. The project is a shopping app that allows users to add items to a shopping cart and purchase them. The app is built using Angular.
The products data is stored in [Click to view src/assets/data.json](src/assets/data.json) and is loaded into the app using the Angular HttpClient.
The purchases are fictional and are not actually processed.
Click a product to see its details. Add as many products as you like to your cart. 
Click the cart tab to see your cart. When you are ready to purchase, input your name, credit card number, and address. The submit button will be activated once those fields are filled out with valid input. Click the submit button to complete your purchase. You will be redirected to a successful purchase page.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
